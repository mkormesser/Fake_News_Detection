# Fake_News_Detection
Fake News Detection
The purpose of this project is to compare existing research on fake news and compare the fake news data collected from social media to the fake news detected from media outlets. Ultimately, we seek to determine which information source exhibits the highest prevalence of fake news and quantify the extent of this phenomenon. We intend to compare the performance of three models discussed in class and determine which is best for fake news detection given the collected data sets.

The Models we have chosen below all are useful for a Supervised learning task. Our features will be the text and the target will be the label or if the text is True of Fake.

 Logistic Regression
Neural Network - Multilayer Perceptron
Transformer- NLP
